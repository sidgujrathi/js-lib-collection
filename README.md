# Javascript Library / Helper Collection

These various collection of reusable libraries / helpers provide pre-written JavaScript code which makes common or complex tasks easy to do.

>*These Classes, Modules, Functions are mostly used in Node.Js but some of them are very generic and independent of platform so can be use in any other Javascript platform.*

## Usage

These are very easy to use and integrate in required project, just copy these into your `lib` or `helper` folders according to code and you can import these wherever necessory

## Documentation

> For ducumenting code in each library I have used `jsdoc`
